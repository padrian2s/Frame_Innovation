rack. It can easily be released by a customer (with one hand), but you need to
take the clothes out one at a time. To prevent the theft of cosmetics, the shelf
depth was reduced, and the front of the shelf was replaced by a tilted panel with
product information and advertising. As soon as a customer reaches for the
product, the panel and the product light up (figure 2.6), reminding those with
a bad conscience that they have just activated a motion detector. In this case,
the development of the problem away from countermeasures and delving into
the complexities of the specific theft situations has led to multiple frames that
spark a rich field of possible solutions (Dorst 2011).

LEARNING FROM THE PIONEERS

These case studies provide a first glimpse into a different, design-based
approach to solving problems, which overcomes the classic syndromes that
obstructed progress in the cases covered in chapter 1. A first batch of general
lessons can be drawn to inform the application of such design-based practices
across a wider range of application areas and organizations.
