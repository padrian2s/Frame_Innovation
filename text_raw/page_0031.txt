it is very hard for organizations to understand their own role in creating the
disconnect, let alone to change their singular approach into a more collaborative one once the project is under way. Once the process has started off on the
wrong foot, it is very hard to change. In the commercial world, projects that
have started without an open engagement with the people they are setting out
to create value for are very hard to redirect (Harkema 2012). In public-sector
consultation processes, parties often dig in after an initial skirmish, and at that
point the whole process shifts from dealing with the problem to discussions
that focus only on “position bargaining.” In all the open, complex, dynamic,
and networked problem situations above, the problem-solving situation can
move forward only through collaboration.
