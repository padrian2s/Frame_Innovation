be called dispassionate. Even the civil servants, whose personal distance to the
issues was probably the greatest of all stakeholders, got caught up in the emotional and personal impact of the process and groupthink. Their assumptions
and power structures were challenged, and they felt threatened. (6) Theory
leads practice—this may have been true initially (in an esoteric planning stage,
before the discussions started), but soon the very practical nature of the problem took over. From that moment, all stakeholders were thrown into the situation, and not only did the individual parties lose sight of the overview, they
actively chose to work from a limited understanding of the broader situation.
(7) Rational action takes place in a closed world—this has never been a closed or
contained problem arena. System borders changed, new information came in
all the time, the learning processes of all the various parties drove the development of new standpoints, coalitions of convenience between stakeholders were
created and died, etc.
