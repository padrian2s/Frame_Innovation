SERIES FOREWORD

As professions go, design is relatively young. The practice of design predates
professions. In fact, the practice of design—making things to serve a useful
goal, making tools—predates the human race. Making tools is one of the attributes that made us human in the first place.
Design, in the most generic sense of the word, began over 2.5 million years
ago when Homo habilis manufactured the first tools. Human beings were
designing well before we began to walk upright. Four hundred thousand years
ago, we began to manufacture spears. By forty thousand years ago, we had
moved up to specialized tools.
Urban design and architecture came along ten thousand years ago in Mesopotamia. Interior architecture and furniture design probably emerged with
them. It was another five thousand years before graphic design and typography
got their start in Sumer with the development of cuneiform. After that, things
picked up speed.
All goods and services are designed. The urge to design—to consider a situation, imagine a better situation, and act to create that improved situation—
goes back to our prehuman ancestors. Making tools helped us to become what
we are—design helped to make us human.
Today, the word “design” means many things. The common factor linking
them is service, and designers are engaged in a service profession in which the
results of their work meet human needs.
Design is first of all a process. The word “design” entered the English language in the sixteenth century as a verb, with the first written citation of the
verb dated to the year 1548. Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary defines the
verb “design” as “to conceive and plan out in the mind; to have as a specific
purpose; to devise for a specific function or end.” Related to these definitions
is the act of drawing, with an emphasis on the nature of the drawing as a plan
