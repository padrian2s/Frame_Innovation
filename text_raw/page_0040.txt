PIONEERS

THE YOUNG DESIGNERS FOUNDATION

To explore how design-based practices can provide an alternative to conventional problem-solving and can drive innovation, we will now investigate projects carried out by two pioneering organizations that use design practices to
develop radically different approaches to problems. Together they have more
than thirty years of experience in this area.
The Young Designers foundation (YD/) was founded in Holland in 1990 as
Young Designers and Industry. Initially, it did just what its name says: create
projects that helped young designers and artists get valuable experience by
working on projects for major industrial partners. Since the late 1990s, the
emphasis of the organization has shifted, and YD/ has become a cultural institution that initiates and develops design projects within the context of cultural
and societal change—under the banner “Design for Society.” Three case studies
will give a first idea of what they do and how they do it. In the last section of
this chapter, we will begin to extract lessons that can be applied across a wide
range of organizations.
