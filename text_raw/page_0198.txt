generator” guiding a possible interpretation of the problem situation—and we
follow the twists and turns of the designer closely, it reads as a very coherent
story. From this analysis, we find that expert designers tend to go through the
steps of the frame creation process, but implicitly and fluidly. The elements of
frame creation are there. In developing the frame creation method, we have
straightened out these steps and brought them into a possibly logical order.
But that is for modeling purposes—in reality, the steps will be executed in close
interaction with one another, as the frame creators have to balance creative
steps with analysis and reflection all the time. (This study later led to the Delft
Protocols Workshop [Cross, Christiaans, and Dorst 1996].)
