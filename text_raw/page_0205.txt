we have learned a lot about frame creation, there is much more to discover.
And several limitations of the frame creation approach to date need to be
addressed: (1) The application of the frame creation methodology raises fundamental questions about the nature of the link between this type of “design”
problem-solving and other types of problem-solving. (2) The current frame
creation approach is based on observations of expert behavior from just two
design fields (architecture and industrial design). Study of the practices of
other design professions might lead to the discovery of other frame creation
practices and methods. (3) The scope and variety of the problems that frame
creation can deal with need to be explored. (4) If the goal of developing the
frame creation methodology is to build up frame creation capacity in an organization (and reach true frame innovation), we need to create bridges into the
academic fields of management, organization studies, and entrepreneurship.
These four critical questions outline the philosophical analysis, empirical
studies, methodology development, critical experiments, and transdisciplinary
embedding that are needed to develop the frame creation model to its full
potential, and to further the broader frame innovation discourse.
