THE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES

OF FRAME CREATION

THE PRINCIPLES OF FRAME CREATION

The frame creation model as described in chapter 4 outlines a process, a series
of nine steps that guide us through the complex practice of frame creation. The
division of this practice into nine steps helps the problem solver by separating
out different kinds of activities and sorting them into coherent units of thinking and doing, which can then each be evaluated as to the thoroughness and
quality of their execution as the process moves on. A disadvantage of this process model is that it looks deceptively linear. While the nine steps of the frame
creation model can be seen as a general and logical progression, in practice
the activities that are captured in the steps all interact with each other—in a
frame creation session there is a constant to-ing and fro-ing between the steps,
and that is absolutely crucial in order to arrive at a good and balanced result
to the frame creation process. The deceptively linear progression of the nine
steps also obscures the fact that the starting point for a frame creation project
can actually occur at any of the stages—the world doesn’t always provide us
with a neat “old” problem to react against, as was the case in the three projects presented in the last chapter. In the next paragraphs, we will see that new
technical opportunities and entrepreneurial initiatives can also spark a frame
creation process, as well as the pure inspiration that comes from exploring an
interesting theme. In all these cases the starting point for frame creation is
different and the process doesn’t quite follow the progression of the nine steps.
So the nine-step model, while it is useful, should in no way become a
straitjacket to the practitioner. To create some much-needed flexibility in
frame creation, we will now move away from describing it in terms of a set
process and describe the deeper principles of the frame creation approach to
