THE FRAME CREATION MODEL

Figure 4.2

The Sydney Opera House podium.

The traditional security response to a problem like this would be to increase
the level of security and to block or restrict access to the podium of the Opera
House. Indeed, an eminent criminologist has suggested fencing off the whole
area and charging an entry fee. An incident in 2005 confounded the traditional
security response and the Opera House wanted a different solution—particularly because the podium area is a very beautiful spot to experience the special
architecture of the Opera House, especially when the white sails reflect the
light of the sun or moon. Over the years, many solutions have been considered,
but it has proved difficult to reach consensus on what should be done.

ESTABLISHING THE CORE PARADOX

The core paradox that the Sydney Opera House originally faced, under pressure
to take measures to prevent people from climbing up the sails, can be paraphrased as:
Because the Sydney Opera House is such a special place and an iconic building, it attracts protesters who seek attention.
Because the Sydney Opera House is such an iconic building, it cannot be
touched/altered (due to heritage listing).
