CHAPTER 4

to these two-hour frame creation sessions. The outcome of the session is a
number of possibly useful frames that need to be explored in depth before a
definitive choice can be made and the developers of the solution can be briefed.
Fourth: although these three case studies may give the impression that this
process is extraordinarily elaborate and convoluted, the reader can rest assured
that it feels quite natural, even when all nine steps are carried out in the short
space of a two-hour workshop. The twists and turns in the reasoning patterns
that characterize the different steps really build on each other fluently. One
also may feel that this frame creation process takes the long way around to
solve a problem where shortcuts would perhaps be possible. This is not the case.
The frame creation model effectively and efficiently combines the five lessons
we have drawn from problem-focused design practice in a simple, deliberate,
and thorough process. The model’s strength lies in the fact that the open, complex, dynamic, and networked nature of the problem situation is not denied but
embraced: the very openness, complexity, dynamism, and networked nature of
the problem is used as the road to creating a solution.
Fifth, and finally: the three cases presented here focus mostly on questions
of the public domain, and thus gravitate toward the public sector. This tendency results from the fact that the public sector was the first to recognize the
potential of the frame creation model. Now that the model is in place, leading
commercial companies across a broad range of sectors are interested in taking
the frame creation approach further within their respective domains, including healthcare, pharmaceutics, food, and transport. Early results show that the
frame creation approach delivers equally interesting results in these domains.
