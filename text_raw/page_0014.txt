ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

This book is the culmination of many years of design practice and design
research, in close collaboration with many friends and colleagues. In my career
I have been very fortunate to have met outstanding designers, design researchers, and design educators, and to have had the opportunity to work with them
on the common quest for understanding design and developing the field. I am
very grateful for their generosity, guidance, help, and friendship.
These acknowledgments include colleagues from TU Delft (Jan, Nigel, Norbert, Henri, Peter, Frido, Rianne, Remko, Rens, Paul, Pieter, and many others),
TU Eindhoven (Aarnout, Jeu, Ilse, Christelle, Ad, Vera, Anthonie, Lambèr, Wybo,
and again many others), and the dear colleagues that have welcomed me at UTS
(Douglas, Sue, Desley, Jaqui, Louise, Hael, Attila, …). The Young Designers foundation has been a constant source of inspiration for over twenty years, thanks
to Peik, Titia, Dennis, and the many designers I met through them. Particular
thanks should go to my current colleagues at the Design Innovation research
center in Sydney. I am grateful for the support the Designing Out Crime center
has received from my universities—the University of Technology, Sydney, and
Eindhoven University of Technology—and from the New South Wales Department of Justice, Police and Attorney General, as well as from numerous project
partners and students who have collaborated with us over the years. A special thanks should go to people who have been particularly important—instrumental, I should say—in the development of the frame creation approach:
Peik Suyling, Dick Rijken, Douglas Tomkin, and Willem Knoop. Through many
inspiring conversations, they have nurtured the thoughts that have slowly
formed into the approaches and models that have now landed on these pages.
The Dru yoga community has been an important source of sustenance and
inspiration over the years (thank you, Franklin, Andrew, and everybody).
