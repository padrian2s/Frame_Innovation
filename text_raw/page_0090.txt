THE FRAME CREATION MODEL

FRAME CREATION

In this chapter, we will see how the five problem-focused design practices
described in the previous chapter (coevolution, developing problem situations,
creating frames, exploring themes, and fostering a discourse) can provide a
new angle for approaching the open, complex, dynamic, and networked problems that were introduced in chapter 1. These design practices are well positioned to help us develop the problem situation, consider a broader context,
build a deeper understanding of the underlying factors behind the problem,
and most importantly to then create a new approach (or frame) to the problem
situation. It is not hard to see how adopting these design practices could be
useful in alleviating the syndromes that prevent organizations from moving
forward. These lessons from design can, to some extent, be applied separately;
for instance, some “design thinking” techniques that have been developed in
companies and business schools utilize elements of “framing.” But in chapter
2, we saw that the Young Designers foundation and the Designing Out Crime
center have evolved a more comprehensive approach in which these design
practices are combined to great effect. They have proven that the ability to
create new frames leads to true novelty and innovation. My first encounter
with this fascinating design practice through a project of the Young Designers foundation led to a twenty-year-long collaboration with them to explore
its possibilities. In over 100 experimental projects, the frame creation process
was honed in various problem contexts and on different scales of complexity, difficulty, and scope. These early insights sparked academic research into
design thinking, including the study of problem-solving behavior in top industrial designers (appendix 1 and Dorst and Dijkhuis 1995) and multidisciplinary
