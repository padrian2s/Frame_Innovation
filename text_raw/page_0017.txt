PREFACE

methods together could be compared to a do-it-yourself guide: a deep understanding of the principles and practices of frame creation will help the practitioner to develop his or her own approach to achieving radical innovation.
This book can be read in several ways. Chapter 4 contains the core model
of the frame creation approach, and the nineteen case studies illustrate its use
in a lively, situated, and pragmatic manner. The broader text creates a much
deeper understanding of the “why” and “how,” and explains how frame creation
practice can radically extend our current approaches for creating innovation.
Over the years of studying designers and experimenting with frame creation,
I have become convinced that this is an immensely valuable new approach to
resolving problems, and create the new thinking that is sorely needed to deal
with the newly open, complex, dynamic, and networked nature of today’s world.
