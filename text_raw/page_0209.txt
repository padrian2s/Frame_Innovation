unfathomable. Careful study of the language of the renku master helps us
understand this crucial design skill on a much deeper level.
In Hindu philosophy, a deeper understanding of the world is achieved
through connecting to a series of levels of meaning. This is a strong personal
inspiration for me, as it is connected to my yoga practice in the Dru yoga tradition. Inadvertently and inevitably, this book contains many layered models of
design and its relationship with the world. A direct link to the practice of frame
creation can be found in the Indian notion of the koshas. The koshas describe
five distinct layers of potential human involvement in action, which can be
used as a map of how we as humans relate to the world and act in it: (1) First is
the physical layer, which concerns our actions, physical reality, and our awareness of these facts. (2) The second layer deals with notions of energy and flow,
and also where we direct our energy (the impetus for action). (3) The third layer
describes how we relate to the world, and involves the emotions. (4) Fourth is
the layer of intellectual understanding, thoughts, and convictions. (5) Layer
five holds the deeply felt connection to the larger world, and is experienced as a
sense of peace and stillness. Interestingly, this fifth layer is not seen as a goal in
itself: within the Hindu tradition, wisdom is defined as being highly developed
on all of these five levels. The frame creation approach strives to be complete in
this sense too by considering action, impetus, emotion, discriminating thought,
and broader learning in its steps.
