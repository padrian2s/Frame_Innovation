THE ART OF FRAME INNOVATION

MAKING IT HAPPEN

Frame creation is a situated process that requires new thinking every time. So
there will never be a “recipe,” a set of actions that can be followed more or less
thoughtlessly, by anyone, at any moment, and that will lead to good results
(Suchman 1987). This book therefore seeks to deliver the next best thing: a
keen understanding of the principles and practices of frame creation that will
help the practitioner to be thoughtful and flexible in achieving radical innovation. If anything, this book is a do-it-yourself manual rather than a how-to
guide. This final chapter will look at some of the key lessons learned over the
years of applying frame creation in various contexts, and will support readers
with practical advice to take away on their path to integrating frame creation
practices in their ways of working, and becoming frame innovators in their own
right. But first, let’s bring back the practice perspective through an extensive
case study, described in terms of the nine-step frame creation model. Critical
moments in this process will be used to illustrate the advice, tools, and methods that follow.
