CHAPTER 3

within the solar system, we can predict where a planet will be at a certain time.
The calculations to support this prediction are very complicated, but in the
end reasoning deductively toward a prediction is not problematic. With our
knowledge of the elements in the situation and the pattern of their relationships (as defined by the laws of gravity), we know enough to safely deduce the
outcome. Our forecast can be verified by observations, confirming that we have
considered all the players in the situation correctly and have a sound grasp of
the pattern of relationships through which the sun and the planets in the solar
system interact. Of all the reasoning patterns we humans have at our disposal,
deduction is the only one that is rock-solid. In terms of our simple equation,
the starting position for deductive thinking looks like this:
