strategies, particular knowledge, special skills, and a range of possible solutions that are all part of the common heritage. It contains strategic statements
on the kinds of knowledge and abilities that must be brought together by the
management to set the scene for projects, ensuring that they are in line with
the company’s “philosophy.” The discourse is embodied in the physical spaces
in which the designers are working (designers tend to “live” in their projects),
the methods and tools they are expected to use, and the human resources
policy. It captures the experience of the firm as it has developed (resulting in
“common stories”) for further use in upcoming challenges (Hargardon and Sutton 2000; Hirshberg 1998).
All together, the elements of the discourse, its frames and themes, constitute the intellectual capital of the firm (Coles 2012). The term “capital” can be
taken quite literally here: expert designers are not approached by clients for
the skills that they possess (these are often widespread) but for their approach
to problem situations.
