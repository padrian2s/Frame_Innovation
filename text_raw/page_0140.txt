ability to generate internal justifications. Solutions are considered to be “right”
because they are conceived rationally within the frame, in a process of seemingly objective steps. Yet when a solution is “right” within the internal rationality of the frame, this doesn’t mean that it is “right” in relation to the outside
world. The second major risk of this strategy is the belief that sticking with routine responses will always be the most efficient way to tackle a problem situation. This is a real discussion stopper because nobody is against efficiency. But
efficiency can be deceptive, because following this strategy can easily lead to
ineffective measures being executed very efficiently. The third hazard of kneejerk problem-solving is that by not reevaluating its own frame, the organization is also not scrutinizing the frames of competing players in the field. In this
blinkered state, it could be overtaken by a competitor that has adopted a different approach. Routine problem-solving strategies work well only in a stable
context, when we can trust that the existing frames and their accompanying
scenarios are still effective.
