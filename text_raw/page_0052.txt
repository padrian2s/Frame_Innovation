redesign of the area that would make it fulfill its potential of being a window
to Australia for the millions of visitors who come through every year. Installing
artworks, appropriate seating, planting eucalypt trees from the different states,
building a small informal open-air stage for street performers, if done to the
proper specifications, would all help to prevent vehicle access and save us from
the bollards (see figure 2.5). To minimize the effects of an attack, the designers
also proposed reducing the crush of peak-hour crowds in the area. Thousands
of city workers now take the train from Circular Quay railway station, which
is centrally located above the ferry wharves. By repositioning the entrances
and exits to that railway station away from the center to both sides of the site,
these city workers wouldn’t need to wrestle their way through the throng of
tourists milling around in the central area. This considerably reduces the mass
of people there at any one time, and thus reduces the likelihood and impact of
an act of violence.
