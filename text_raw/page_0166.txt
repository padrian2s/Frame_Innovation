THE THREE CHALLENGES OF FRAME INNOVATION

149

by the adherence of the entrepreneuring scholars to Herbert Simon’s theories—
entrepreneurial activity is thus seen through the rather limiting lens of rational
problem-solving. Notions like interpretation and framing do not come into this
yet, but given the direction we have taken in this book, one can easily see where
connections can be made. Frame innovation is a key entrepreneurial activity.
To conclude, there is much that can be learned from innovation management,
and the field has contributed enormously to the innovative capacity of organizations. It has flagged many problems that are very real in practice, reflected
upon them, and proposed avenues of solution that are very relevant. It has also
provided a context for innovation in organizations. However, in its modeling
of innovation, the field of innovation management has adapted to the “manufacturing” type of organization as it has developed in the industrial economy
(Smulders 2006), and many of the critical remarks above stem from the difficulties that arise from the compromises that accompany this adaptation. Frame
creation is, in a sense, more radical in that it steps away from that image of an
organization and takes its inspiration from the knowledge economy. But this
means that frame creation often doesn’t fit easily in the existing processes of
organizations that are structured along the principles of the industrial economy. While this is a deep and fundamental difference that as such cannot be
resolved, some key frame creation tools and practices have been developed to
traverse this terrain. They will be introduced in the next chapter.
