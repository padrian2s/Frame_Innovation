CHAPTER 5

of guilt that go along with such a care situation (caregivers often feel selfish
when they do something to help themselves), and the realization that solutions
should not have any feeling of obligation attached to them. The concrete interventions that were designed thus steered away from the conventional solutions of organizing events to distract and amuse the lonely, or bringing them
together in groups to talk to each other so they won’t be lonely. While these
are all useful and honorable things to do, the Young Designers project moved
on toward much more subtle approaches aimed at helping these caregivers to
build up their own mental strength.

TRANSFORMATION

The Young Designers foundation and project partners (the Verwey-Jonker
Institute and the Stichting DOEN) realize that this approach requires a new
type of organization, one that doesn’t try to “fix” loneliness through intervening in situations where loneliness occurs, but rather one that takes people on
an important journey of learning and development. The working title of this
fledgling initiative is the “Academy for Loneliness.”
Please note that even within such very different frame creation projects, all
nine steps of the frame creation process model (figure 4.1) should be addressed
at some point to ensure a balanced outcome. But these varieties of frame creation projects also show that there is an inner strength and logic to the frame
creation approach, a consistent quality that can be achieved in projects of many
shapes and sizes. In chapter 7 we will delve deeper into the nature of frame
creation as a way of thinking and acting, because the better we understand the
core qualities of frame creation, the more flexible we can be in its application.
