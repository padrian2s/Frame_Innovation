of action. Included in such a team are content specialists who have a deep and
broad knowledge of the problem arena and are able to feed fresh information
into all the stages of the frame creation process as new questions come up. As in
other design activities, the environment in which frame creation processes take
place needs to be rich in inspiration and conducive to reflection (see chapter 3).
