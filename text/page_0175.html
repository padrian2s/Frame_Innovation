      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Frame creation breaks deadlocks by changing the terms of the problem. When all conventional approaches have failed, it opens different, more productive forms of action.</p>

    <div class="commentary-section">

      <p>Implementation follows frame creation's own principles — deep understanding, underlying concerns, collaborative engagement, attractive solutions. The method is self-applying.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Begin with small, focused projects. Document process and outcomes. Use successes to build advocacy. Let frame innovation grow organically — don't try to transform everything at once.</p>
