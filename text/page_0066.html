      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Design abduction has a special character: it proposes something that does not yet exist to create a desired outcome. A fundamentally creative form of reasoning that cannot be reduced to deduction or induction.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Design reasoning is abductive and generative. The five practices (coevolution, problem situations, frames, themes, discourse) work as an integrated system. Expertise means comfort with complexity and ability to hold multiple frames.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Practice abductive reasoning: work backward from desired outcomes. Instead of 'what can we do with what we have?' ask 'what would it look like if this were truly solved?' This reversal opens new possibilities.</p>
