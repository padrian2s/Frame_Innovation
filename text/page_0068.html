      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Two types of design abduction: (1) Closed — value and 'how' are known, only 'what' needs designing (routine design). (2) Open — only value is known, both 'what' and 'how' must be created (where framing happens). Open abduction is the more powerful form.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Design reasoning is abductive and generative. The five practices (coevolution, problem situations, frames, themes, discourse) work as an integrated system. Expertise means comfort with complexity and ability to hold multiple frames.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Practice abductive reasoning: work backward from desired outcomes. Instead of 'what can we do with what we have?' ask 'what would it look like if this were truly solved?' This reversal opens new possibilities.</p>
