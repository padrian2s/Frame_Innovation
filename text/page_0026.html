      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Dorst defines key terms. 'Open': unclear system boundaries, can't safely exclude factors. 'Complex': many elements with interdependent connections where small decisions create chain effects. These problems resist decomposition — severing relations creates new problems.</p>

    <div class="definition-box"><strong>Open Problem:</strong> A problem with unclear or permeable system boundaries — you cannot safely exclude factors or stakeholders.</div>
    <div class="definition-box"><strong>Complex Problem:</strong> Many elements with interdependent connections where small decisions create chain effects across seemingly unrelated areas.</div>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Conventional problem-solving fails not because practitioners are incompetent, but because problems have fundamentally changed. The five syndromes are deeply human patterns that become traps in complex, networked environments.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Check for the five syndromes in your organization: Lone Warrior? Freeze the World? Self-Made Box? Rational High Ground? Identity around practices? Recognizing these patterns is the first step.</p>

      <h4>Real-World Example</h4>
      <p>Climate change: open (which emissions? which countries?), complex (energy, agriculture, transport, behavior, geopolitics), dynamic (technology, politics), networked (policy in China affects markets in Europe). No conventional approach can handle this.</p>
