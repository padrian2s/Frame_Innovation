      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Three reasoning forms: Deduction (general → specific), Induction (specific → general), Abduction (proposing hypotheses). Design reasoning is fundamentally abductive — proposing new possibilities rather than deriving from existing knowledge. This is why design creates genuine novelty.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="definition-box"><strong>Deduction:</strong> General principles → specific conclusions (what must be true).</div>
    <div class="definition-box"><strong>Induction:</strong> Specific observations → general patterns (what might be true).</div>
    <div class="definition-box"><strong>Abduction:</strong> Proposing hypotheses to explain or create (what could be true).</div>
    <div class="commentary-section">
      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Design reasoning is abductive and generative. The five practices (coevolution, problem situations, frames, themes, discourse) work as an integrated system. Expertise means comfort with complexity and ability to hold multiple frames.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Practice abductive reasoning: work backward from desired outcomes. Instead of 'what can we do with what we have?' ask 'what would it look like if this were truly solved?' This reversal opens new possibilities.</p>

      <h4>Real-World Example</h4>
      <p>Wet kitchen floor. Deduction: 'pipe leaks, so floor is wet.' Induction: 'floor is wet every morning, so something leaks regularly.' Abduction: 'maybe pipe, maybe dog, maybe condensation.' Design abduction: 'I want a dry floor — what if I redesign the layout so water never accumulates?'</p>
