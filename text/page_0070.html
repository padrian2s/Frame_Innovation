      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Central formula: WHAT + HOW (frame) = VALUE. A 'frame' is the proposal that a particular pattern of relationships can create a desired outcome. The coffee example: caffeine (chemical), conversation (social), meditation (clarity) — each frame yields entirely different solutions.</p>

    <div class="definition-box"><strong>Frame:</strong> A proposal that by applying a particular pattern of relationships (HOW), we can create a desired outcome (VALUE). Framing is the key to design abduction.</div>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Design reasoning is abductive and generative. The five practices (coevolution, problem situations, frames, themes, discourse) work as an integrated system. Expertise means comfort with complexity and ability to hold multiple frames.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Practice abductive reasoning: work backward from desired outcomes. Instead of 'what can we do with what we have?' ask 'what would it look like if this were truly solved?' This reversal opens new possibilities.</p>

      <h4>Real-World Example</h4>
      <p>Reducing childhood obesity. Frame 1 (medical): prescribe diets. Frame 2 (urban): design walkable neighborhoods. Frame 3 (cultural): create cooking/eating norms. Frame 4 (economic): make healthy food more accessible. Same problem, radically different interventions.</p>
