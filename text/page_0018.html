      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Dorst opens with a powerful diagnosis: we are collectively failing to solve contemporary problems. Boutellier captures the predicament — cacophony, ad hoc policy, fumbling without guiding concepts. The cause: a 'radically new species of problem' that is open, complex, dynamic, and networked.</p>

    <div class="definition-box"><strong>Open, Complex, Dynamic, and Networked Problems:</strong> A new species of problem — so open (unclear boundaries), complex (interconnected elements), dynamic (constantly changing), and networked (mutually influencing) that conventional approaches fail.</div>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Conventional problem-solving fails not because practitioners are incompetent, but because problems have fundamentally changed. The five syndromes are deeply human patterns that become traps in complex, networked environments.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Check for the five syndromes in your organization: Lone Warrior? Freeze the World? Self-Made Box? Rational High Ground? Identity around practices? Recognizing these patterns is the first step.</p>

      <h4>Real-World Example</h4>
      <p>Consider traffic congestion. Wider roads attract more cars. Copenhagen reframed: instead of managing car traffic, design for bicycles and public life. Result: less congestion AND a better urban experience.</p>
