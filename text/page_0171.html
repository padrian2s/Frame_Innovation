      <p>The semiparadox: implementing frame innovation requires frame innovation. Organization's resistance is itself a problem situation that can be reframed. Practitioners must apply the method to their own situation.</p>

    <div class="definition-box"><strong>Semiparadox:</strong> Implementing frame innovation itself requires frame innovation — the resistance to new approaches is itself a reframable problem situation.</div>
    <div class="commentary-section">
      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Implementation follows frame creation's own principles — deep understanding, underlying concerns, collaborative engagement, attractive solutions. The method is self-applying.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Begin with small, focused projects. Document process and outcomes. Use successes to build advocacy. Let frame innovation grow organically — don't try to transform everything at once.</p>

      <h4>Real-World Example</h4>
      <p>A company needs to innovate but can't get past its culture. Semiparadox: needs frame innovation to solve problems, but resistance to frame innovation IS the problem. Resolution: start small, demonstrate value, let practice spread organically.</p>
