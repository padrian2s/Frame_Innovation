      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Scientists use abduction extensively (every hypothesis is an abductive leap) but test against existing reality. In design, abductive hypotheses create new realities. Design abduction is open and exploratory rather than explanatory.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Design reasoning is abductive and generative. The five practices (coevolution, problem situations, frames, themes, discourse) work as an integrated system. Expertise means comfort with complexity and ability to hold multiple frames.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Practice abductive reasoning: work backward from desired outcomes. Instead of 'what can we do with what we have?' ask 'what would it look like if this were truly solved?' This reversal opens new possibilities.</p>
