      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Coevolution: problem and solution develop simultaneously. Understanding the problem suggests solutions, which reveal new problem aspects. This dance is fundamentally different from linear problem→solution approaches.</p>

    <div class="definition-box"><strong>Coevolution:</strong> Simultaneous development of problem understanding and solution concepts, each informing and refining the other through iterative cycles.</div>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Design reasoning is abductive and generative. The five practices (coevolution, problem situations, frames, themes, discourse) work as an integrated system. Expertise means comfort with complexity and ability to hold multiple frames.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Practice abductive reasoning: work backward from desired outcomes. Instead of 'what can we do with what we have?' ask 'what would it look like if this were truly solved?' This reversal opens new possibilities.</p>
