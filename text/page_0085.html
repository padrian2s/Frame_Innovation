      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Expert designers thrive in complexity because their practices are evolved for it. Where conventional solvers see chaos, designers see possibility. This comfort is skill-based, not personality-based.</p>

      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Design reasoning is abductive and generative. The five practices (coevolution, problem situations, frames, themes, discourse) work as an integrated system. Expertise means comfort with complexity and ability to hold multiple frames.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Practice abductive reasoning: work backward from desired outcomes. Instead of 'what can we do with what we have?' ask 'what would it look like if this were truly solved?' This reversal opens new possibilities.</p>
