      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Frame innovation is not a silver bullet but a powerful addition to the repertoire. Most valuable where conventional approaches fail. Learnable, systematic, evidence-based, grounded in 50+ years of research.</p>

    <div class="commentary-section">
      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Implementation follows frame creation's own principles — deep understanding, underlying concerns, collaborative engagement, attractive solutions. The method is self-applying.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Begin with small, focused projects. Document process and outcomes. Use successes to build advocacy. Let frame innovation grow organically — don't try to transform everything at once.</p>
