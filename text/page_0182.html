      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Universities contribute research methods and rigor; industry contributes real problems and implementation capacity. Together: a learning environment for developing and testing frame creation skills.</p>

    <div class="commentary-section">

    <div class="commentary-section">
      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Begin with small, focused projects. Document process and outcomes. Use successes to build advocacy. Let frame innovation grow organically — don't try to transform everything at once.</p>
