      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>Advanced techniques: working with multiple frames simultaneously, building composites from several proposals, rapid prototyping to test implications. For extreme complexity or urgency.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="commentary-section">
      <h4>Key Patterns</h4>
      <p>Implementation follows frame creation's own principles — deep understanding, underlying concerns, collaborative engagement, attractive solutions. The method is self-applying.</p>

      <h4>Practical Applications</h4>
      <p>Begin with small, focused projects. Document process and outcomes. Use successes to build advocacy. Let frame innovation grow organically — don't try to transform everything at once.</p>
